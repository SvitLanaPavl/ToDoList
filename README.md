# ToDoList
This is the first simple interactive app I created using JavaScript knowledge. It includes two input fields: for typing the task and for searching. When the item appears, it has a check button you can click, and it automatically crosses out the task. Also, you can look for an item by inputing letters in the search field which also generates some behavior.
